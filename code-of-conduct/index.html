<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<h2>ND in Tech Mission Statement</h2>

<p>
  Neurodiversity In Tech (ND in Tech, for short) is an online community dedicated to supporting neurodivergent
  professionals in the technology industry. Our mission is to enable members to network, navigate their
  careers, and empower each other while advocating for meaningful social change. ND in Tech serves as a
  crucial hub for sharing experiences, offering support, and promoting inclusivity within the tech world. We
  aim to create a welcoming environment where diversity is celebrated and every individual feels valued.
</p>

<h2>Scope of This Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
  This code of conduct applies to interactions between members of this community within the spaces that ND in
  Tech hosts.
</p>

<h3>In Scope</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Inside of ND in Tech's Slack</li>
  <li>At ND in Tech events - virtual or in person</li>
</ul>

<h3>Out of Scope</h3>

<p>
  There are situations outside of the control of ND in Tech representatives. We make no representation that we
  can enforce this code of conduct in these scenarios:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interactions on other online platforms not administered by ND in Tech representatives.</li>
  <li>In-person meet-ups not sponsored by ND in Tech.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We will consider <span class="italic">any</span> harassing behavior discovered by ND in Tech representative
  as a matter that could affect the health of the community and take appropriate actions as listed in the
  Grievance Review Process.
</p>

<h2>Community Membership/Inclusion</h2>

Membership is for neurodivergent professionals in technology or those who support such individuals in a
professional capacity. A medical diagnosis is not needed to join the community.

<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bring your authentic self.</li>
  <li>Treat all members with dignity and respect.</li>
  <li>Support and uplift members of the community.</li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-the-manager/202203/when-in-doubt-assume-positive-intent"
      >Assume positive intent.</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep conversation roughly in line with the subject of the channels in Slack - there are plenty of channels
    that cover a variety of conversational topics. A full list of channels is maintained in
    <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onKGnfX7Qz-mZV7OcEPF-lli0HvaW2aAWs0SGP7o1OM/edit#heading=h.s45mwzvl0wfb"
      >this Google Doc</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Intercede or report any abusive or malicious behavior towards other members. Don't assume that ND in Tech
    representatives will see it unless they are already actively responding.
  </li>
</ul>

    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Schrodingers%20asshole"
      >Schrodinger's Assholes</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bigotry</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    No undertones, comments, or slurs that target any marginalized communities, including but not limited to
    those targeting sex, gender identity, ethnicity, race, age, or disability.
  </li>
  <li>
    We do not require our members to have an official diagnosis. This group focuses on supporting those who
    are neurodivergent and work in tech which. Our community focus does not include neurotypical people but
    that is only a matter of focus, not exclusion.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is not a universal "presentation" for any specific neurodivergent sub-group - behavioral,
    appearance, or philosophic outlooks.
  </li>
  <li>
    We do not tolerate exclusion of people because they aren't  enough.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Violence</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Threats of physical harm will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>No conversations focused on violence or acts of harm unless they support a larger conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy Concerns</h2>
<h3>Intra-community</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Webcam use is welcome during online meetups but not necessary.</li>
  <li>Always ask for permission in Slack prior to connecting with others outside Slack.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outside of Community</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Don't "out" people of the community. Some members may not want to let their employers or other
    professional/personal relations know aspects of what they may consider their personal, private life. If
    they're comfortable with the wider world knowing about their neurodiversity, they can share that for
    themselves.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't share another member's personal info including email, phone number, Slack handle, or other
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<h3>Reporting Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If someone is in imminent physical harm, contact the appropriate emergency services in their area.</li>
  <li>
    Where possible, attempt to resolve the situation one-on-one with the aggressor. In some cases, there may
    be a misunderstanding. Representative are glad to help with communication advice in such situations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Involve staff where necessary by contacting
    <a href="mailto:nditcommunity@gmail.com">nditcommunity@gmail.com</a> or messaging
    <a href="https://nd-in-tech.slack.com/team/U067LJ5PR8V">Hayley</a>,
    <a href="https://nd-in-tech.slack.com/team/U067TMMH362">Roy</a>, or
    <a href="https://nd-in-tech.slack.com/team/U06924YLB4L">Jennifer</a> on Slack. Be sure to include:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">WHO</span> the incident happened to and who initiated it</li>
      <li><span class="bold">WHAT</span> happened</li>
      <li><span class="bold">WHEN</span> the incident took place</li>
      <li><span class="bold">WHERE</span> it took place</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Grievance Review Process</h3>

  they deem appropriate to resolve the issue. This includes but is not limited to:
